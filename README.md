Data Analysis Process

To analyze a data set there are multiple tools that can be used. One of these tools is an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). An One-Way ANOVA allows the researcher to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between different factors within a data set. 

To be able to conduct a One-Way ANOVA there are three main assumptions that must be met: Normality, Homogeneity of Variance and Independence of Observations. These can be tested and accounted for by running various tests including:  Shapiro Wilks Test to analyze normality, Leveneâ€™s Test to analyze homogeneity, and Experimental Design Analysis to meet Independence of Observations. 

If the Shapiro Wilks Test results in a p-value less than our significance value of 0.05 ( a 95% confidence interval) the null hypothesis is rejected and the assumption is made that the data is not normal. This does not mean that the data cannot be used just that further analysis must be done before the conditions for a One-Way ANOVA are met. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis
